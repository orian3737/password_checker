# Password Checker

This is a Python application that allows users to check if their entered password is unique or a common password. The program reads a list of common passwords from a file (`passwords.txt`) and informs the user if their input matches any of these common passwords.

## Features
- Continuously prompts the user to enter passwords until they decide to exit.
- Checks if the entered password is found in the list of common passwords.
- Displays the position of the password in the common passwords list if it is not unique.
- Indicates when a password is unique.
- Handles empty input gracefully.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the `main.py` and `passwords.txt` files.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
3. Run the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
Enter a password when prompted.
Type exit to quit the program.
Example Usage
bash
Copy code
Enter a Password (or type "exit" to quit): password123
password123: Is Not Unique & is the (#5) most common password!

Enter a Password (or type "exit" to quit): myUniquePassword
myUniquePassword: Is Unique

Enter a Password (or type "exit" to quit): exit
Goodbye!
Requirements
Python 3.x
File Structure
main.py: The main Python script that runs the application.
